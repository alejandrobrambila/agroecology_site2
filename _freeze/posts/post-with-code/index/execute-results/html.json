They are a grassland nesting bird, a guild which initially benefited from agricultural clearing in the 1800s, but has since been in steep decline due to habitat loss, species invasions, changing climate, and agricultural intensification. Bobolinks nest in grasslands from late May through early July, making them sensitive to disturbance precisely during the optimal harvest window for most common forage species.\n\n(Image of bobolink)\n\nThe most common bobolink conservation practice is delaying harvest until sometime between July 15th, when most birds are done nesting and August 15th, when they migrate south. By this point forage quality and economic value has declined substantially, placing a heavy burden on grass farmers. This burden is increased in the case of graziers, where livestock must graze elsewhere for much of the season.\n\nOur study examined the impact of grazing prior to peak nesting activity on both nesting success and quality of summer forage. Our premise was based on research by Dr. Noah Perlut, who found that harvesting through early June, followed by an extended rest period, allowed bobolinks to successfully re-nest in fields. In addition to timing of early season harvest, we also considered the relative influence of forage height, tree and wetland distribution within the study area.\n\nOur primary treatment, harvest timing, was implemented by dividing Appleton's Great Pasture into twenty roughly two-acre plots. Plot locations were selected to maximize the chance of nesting activity based on general background knowledge about where bobolinks tend to nest in fields (away from wooded edges and trees, outside of wetlands) and specific experience with territorial activity in the Great Pasture.\n\n![](base GP.jpg)\n\n![](plot_locations.jpg)\n\nEach year from 2023 through 2025, a herd of \\~25 cows with their calves was rotated through the pasture according to prescriptions for each plot: pre-arrival (prior to May 15th), pre-nesting (May 15th-23rd), early-nesting (May 24th - June 9th), or post-nesting (after July 15th). Prescriptions were evenly distributed, and varied from year to year.\n\n(Image of GP with prescriptions).\n\nNests were found by walking near them and flushing females, or observation of females returning to nests. Across three years, we found 47 bobolink nests. Once nests were found, they were visited every three days to assess timing and success rate of each nest by recording the number and status of eggs and young.\n\n(pictures of nests) 1 x 3\n\n![All nests found in plots with hydric soils (blue) and tree cover (green) highlighted.](found_nests.jpg)\n\n1.  Does grazing between May 15th and June 10th followed by 65 days of rest lead to similar Bobolink nesting outcomes as grazing before May 15th or not at all until July 15th?\n\n    1.  Success rate of later nests (past what date?)\n\n    2.  Also consider abundance/density/frequency (preferences)\n\n        1.  Early season activity – does it reveal different preferences? Relationship to where herds are.\n\n2.  Can the recommended two-week window of regrowth necessary for bobolinks to start nesting in a field following grazing be reduced by leaving more residual?\n\n3.  How do Q1 and Q2 interact? For example:\n\n    1.  Does higher residual (less intense) grazing reduce any negative impacts of grazing between May 15th and June 10th?\n\n    2.  Can leaving a higher residual be a viable strategy to encourage nesting when grass is not growing as quickly later in the season?\n\n4.  How do environmental factors interact with management factors (control)?\n\n    1.  Tree – buffer distance? Categories of trees?\n\n    2.  Precipitation\n\n    3.  Is it only in close proximity to wetter areas? - because it’s wet or because its other species habitat (RWBB – benefit or negative?)\n\n    4.  Nest cover Herbaceous species composition + shrub presence + height\n\n5.  For environmental factors, is there a change in nesting ability/preferences with timing in the season? Interaction between environmental factors and timing. Decoupling, directional change\n\n    1.  Check if large number of nests started after plains/playground/lamson hayed\n\n        -   Arriving numbers vs. Leaving numbers (early and late season)\n\n        -   \n\n6.  Production system: What is the impact of different early grazing rotations (timing) on forage quality/quantity at the end of the nesting season.\n\n    1.  Regrowth period + residual\n\n    2.  Grazing vs haying (refuges)\n\n7.  Can reentry be expedited by monitoring adult feeding activity post-nesting.\n\n    1.  Completely moved on vs. Still around but mobile, still around but vulnerable.\n\n    2.  Does post-fledge period feeding behavior mean there are still non-flying young? Do they keep feeding flying young for some period of time?\n",
